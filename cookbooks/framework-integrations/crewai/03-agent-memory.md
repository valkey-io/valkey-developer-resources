## Step 1: Configure Memory with Bedrock

```python
import boto3
from crewai.memory.unified_memory import Memory
from valkey_storage import ValkeyStorage

def build_memory() -> Memory:
    session = boto3.Session(region_name="us-west-2")
    return Memory(
        storage=ValkeyStorage(),
        llm="bedrock/anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0",
        embedder={
            "provider": "amazon-bedrock",
            "config": {
                "model_name": "amazon.titan-embed-text-v1",
                "session": session,
            },
        },
    )
```

## Step 2: Create an Agent with Memory

```python
from crewai import Agent, Crew, Task

memory = build_memory()

reviewer = Agent(
    role="Senior Code Reviewer",
    goal="Review code for quality, security, and best practices",
    backstory="You are an experienced engineer who has reviewed thousands of PRs.",
    memory=True,
    verbose=True,
)
```

## Step 3: Store Patterns - First Execution

```python
# First crew run - agent learns patterns
learn_task = Task(
    description="""Review this code and remember the patterns you find:
    
    def get_user(id):
        user = db.query(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {id}")
        return user
    """,
    expected_output="Code review with identified patterns",
    agent=reviewer,
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[reviewer],
    tasks=[learn_task],
    memory=memory,
    verbose=True,
)

result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
# Agent identifies: SQL injection risk, no input validation, no error handling
```

**Valkey Commands Fired (store):**

```python
JSON.SET memory:7f3a-b2c1 $ '{"content":"SQL injection risk in get_user...","scope":"/code-review","embedding":[0.12,-0.45,...],...}'
EXPIRE memory:7f3a-b2c1 3600
```

## Step 4: Recall Patterns - Later Execution

```python
# Later crew run - agent recalls what it learned
recall_task = Task(
    description="""Review this new code. Use your memory of past reviews:
    
    def delete_account(user_id):
        db.execute(f"DELETE FROM accounts WHERE user_id = {user_id}")
        return {"status": "deleted"}
    """,
    expected_output="Code review informed by past patterns",
    agent=reviewer,
)

crew2 = Crew(
    agents=[reviewer],
    tasks=[recall_task],
    memory=memory,  # Same memory - recalls from Valkey
    verbose=True,
)

result2 = crew2.kickoff()
print(result2)
# Agent recalls the SQL injection pattern from the first review!
# "I've seen this pattern before - f-string SQL is vulnerable to injection..."
```

**Valkey Commands Fired (recall):**

```bash
FT.SEARCH memory_idx
  "(*)==>[KNN 5 @embedding $vec AS score]"
  PARAMS 2 vec <binary_vector>

# Returns: score 0.94 - "SQL injection risk in get_user..."
```

## Next Steps

Your agents now have persistent, searchable memory backed by Valkey. To deploy to production, see the [ElastiCache for Valkey Getting Started guide](<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/dg/WhatIs.html>) - set `VALKEY_HOST` and `VALKEY_TLS=true` and your `ValkeyStorage` connects to ElastiCache automatically.
